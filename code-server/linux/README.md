Run [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) on any machine anywhere and
access it in the browser.

## Highlights

- Code on any device with a consistent development environment
- Use cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more
- Preserve battery life when you're on the go; all intensive tasks run on your
  server

## Requirements

See [requirements](requirements.md) for minimum specs, as well as instructions
on how to set up a Google VM on which you can install code-server.

**TL;DR:** Linux machine with WebSockets enabled, 1 GB RAM, and 2 CPUs

## Getting started

There are three ways to get started:

1. Using the [install
   script](https://github.com/cdr/code-server/blob/main/install.sh), which
   automates most of the process. The script uses the system package manager if
   possible.
2. Manually [installing
   code-server](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/v3.11.1/install)
3. Using our one-click buttons and guides to [deploy code-server to a cloud
   provider](https://github.com/cdr/deploy-code-server) âš¡

If you use the install script, you can preview what occurs during the install
process:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run
```

To install, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
```

When done, the install script prints out instructions for running and starting
code-server.

We also have an in-depth [setup and
configuration](https://coder.com/docs/code-server/v3.11.1/guide) guide.

### code-server --link

We're working on a cloud platform that makes deploying and managing code-server
easier. Consider running code-server with the beta flag `--link` if you don't
want to worry about:

- TLS
- Authentication
- Port forwarding

```bash
$ code-server --link
Proxying code-server, you can access your IDE at https://example.cdr.co
```
