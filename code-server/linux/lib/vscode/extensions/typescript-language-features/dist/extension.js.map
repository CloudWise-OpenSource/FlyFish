Since the microtask queue is not\n * exposed externally, promises need to be modified in a fairly invasive and\n * complex way.\n *\n * The async boundary in promises that must be patched is between the\n * fulfillment of the promise and the execution of any callback that is waiting\n * for that fulfillment to happen. This means that we need to trigger a create\n * when resolve or reject is called and trigger before, after and error handlers\n * around the callback execution. There may be multiple callbacks for each\n * fulfilled promise, so handlers will behave similar to setInterval where\n * there may be multiple before after and error calls for each create call.\n *\n * async-listener monkeypatching has one basic entry point: `wrapCallback`.\n * `wrapCallback` should be called when create should be triggered and be\n * passed a function to wrap, which will execute the body of the async work.\n * The resolve and reject calls can be modified fairly easily to call\n * `wrapCallback`, but at the time of resolve and reject all the work to be done\n * on fulfillment may not be defined, since a call to then, chain or fetch can\n * be made even after the promise has been fulfilled. To get around this, we\n * create a placeholder function which will call a function passed into it,\n * since the call to the main work is being made from within the wrapped\n * function, async-listener will work correctly.\n *\n * There is another complication with monkeypatching Promises. Calls to then,\n * chain and catch each create new Promises that are fulfilled internally in\n * different ways depending on the return value of the callback. When the\n * callback return a Promise, the new Promise is resolved asynchronously after\n * the returned Promise has been also been resolved. When something other than\n * a promise is resolved the resolve call for the new Promise is put in the\n * microtask queue and asynchronously resolved.\n *\n * Then must be wrapped so that its returned promise has a wrapper that can be\n * used to invoke further continuations. This wrapper cannot be created until\n * after the callback has run, since the callback may return either a promise\n * or another value. Fortunately we already have a wrapper function around the\n * callback we can use (the wrapper created by resolve or reject).\n *\n * By adding an additional argument to this wrapper, we can pass in the\n * returned promise so it can have its own wrapper appended. the wrapper\n * function can the call the callback, and take action based on the return\n * value. If a promise is returned, the new Promise can proxy the returned\n * Promise's wrapper (this wrapper may not exist yet, but will by the time the\n * wrapper needs to be invoked). Otherwise, a new wrapper can be create the\n * same way as in resolve and reject. Since this wrapper is created\n * synchronously within another wrapper, it will properly appear as a\n * continuation from within the callback.\n */\n\nif (instrumentPromise) {\n
