   * as user actions like resize or reset are still processed immediately.
   * It is an error to assume a stable terminal state while giving back control
   * in between, e.g. by multiple chained `then` calls.
   * Downside of an async handler is a rather bad throughput performance,
   * thus use async handlers only as a last resort or for actions that have
   * to rely on async interfaces itself.
