**Important note:** By default, this extension now delegates to [the new js-debug extension](http://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug) which is built-in to VS Code. Please file issues on that repo. To revert to the old behavior, you can set `"debug.javascript.usePreview": false` in your settings.
