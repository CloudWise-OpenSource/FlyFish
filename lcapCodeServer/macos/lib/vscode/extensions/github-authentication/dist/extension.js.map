Since the microtask queue is not\n * exposed externally, promises need to be modified in a fairly invasive and\n * complex way.\n *\n * The async boundary in promises that must be patched is between the\n * fulfillment of the promise and the execution of any callback that is waiting\n * for that fulfillment to happen. This means that we need to trigger a create\n * when resolve or reject is called and trigger before, after and error handlers\n * around the callback execution. There may be multiple callbacks for each\n * fulfilled promise, so handlers will behave similar to setInterval where\n * there may be multiple before after and error calls for each create call.\n *\n * async-listener monkeypatching has one basic entry point: `wrapCallback`.\n * `wrapCallback` should be called when create should be triggered and be\n * passed a function to wrap, which will execute the body of the async work.\n * The resolve and reject calls can be modified fairly easily to call\n * `wrapCallback`, but at the time of resolve and reject all the work to be done\n * on fulfillment may not be defined, since a call to then, chain or fetch can\n * be made even after the promise has been fulfilled. To get around this, we\n * create a placeholder function which will call a function passed into it,\n * since the call to the main work is being made from within the wrapped\n * function, async-listener will work correctly.\n *\n * There is another complication with monkeypatching Promises. Calls to then,\n * chain and catch each create new Promises that are fulfilled internally in\n * different ways depending on the return value of the callback. When the\n * callback return a Promise, the new Promise is resolved asynchronously after\n * the returned Promise has been also been resolved. When something other than\n * a promise is resolved the resolve call for the new Promise is put in the\n * microtask queue and asynchronously resolved.\n *\n * Then must be wrapped so that its returned promise has a wrapper that can be\n * used to invoke further continuations. This wrapper cannot be created until\n * after the callback has run, since the callback may return either a promise\n * or another value. Fortunately we already have a wrapper function around the\n * callback we can use (the wrapper created by resolve or reject).\n *\n * By adding an additional argument to this wrapper, we can pass in the\n * returned promise so it can have its own wrapper appended. the wrapper\n * function can the call the callback, and take action based on the return\n * value. If a promise is returned, the new Promise can proxy the returned\n * Promise's wrapper (this wrapper may not exist yet, but will by the time the\n * wrapper needs to be invoked). Otherwise, a new wrapper can be create the\n * same way as in resolve and reject. Since this wrapper is created\n * synchronously within another wrapper, it will properly appear as a\n * continuation from within the callback.\n */\n\nif (instrumentPromise) {\n  wrapPromise();\n}\n\nfunction wrapPromise() {\n  var Promise = global.Promise;\n\n  // Updates to this class should also be applied to the the ES6 version\n  // in es6-wrapped-promise.js.\n  function wrappedPromise(executor) {\n    if (!(this instanceof wrappedPromise)) {\n      return Promise(executor);\n    }\n\n    if (typeof executor !== 'function') {\n      return new Promise(executor);\n    }\n\n    var context, args;\n    var promise = new Promise(wrappedExecutor);\n    promise.__proto__ = wrappedPromise.prototype;\n\n    try {\n      executor.apply(context, args);\n    } catch (err) {\n      args[1](err);\n    }\n\n    return promise;\n\n    function wrappedExecutor(resolve, reject) {\n      context = this;\n      args = [wrappedResolve, wrappedReject];\n\n      // These wrappers create a function that can be passed a function and an argument to\n      // call as a continuation from the resolve or reject.\n      function wrappedResolve(val) {\n        ensureAslWrapper(promise, false);\n        return resolve(val);\n      }\n\n      function wrappedReject(val) {\n        ensureAslWrapper(promise, false);\n        return reject(val);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  util.inherits(wrappedPromise, Promise);\n\n  wrap(Promise.prototype, 'then', wrapThen);\n  // Node.js <v7 only, alias for .then\n  if (Promise.prototype.chain) {\n    wrap(Promise.prototype, 'chain', wrapThen);\n  }\n\n  if (v6plus) {\n    global.Promise = require('./es6-wrapped-promise.js')(Promise, ensureAslWrapper);\n  } else {\n    var PromiseFunctions = [\n      'all',\n      'race',\n      'reject',\n      'resolve',\n      'accept',  // Node.js <v7 only\n      'defer'    // Node.js <v7 only\n    ];\n\n    PromiseFunctions.forEach(function(key) {\n      // don't break `in` by creating a key for undefined entries\n      if (typeof Promise[key] === 'function') {\n        wrappedPromise[key] = Promise[key];\n      }\n    });\n    global.Promise = wrappedPromise\n  }\n\n  function ensureAslWrapper(promise, overwrite) {\n    if (!promise.__asl_wrapper || overwrite) {\n      promise.__asl_wrapper = wrapCallback(propagateAslWrapper);\n    }\n  }\n\n  function propagateAslWrapper(ctx, fn, result, next) {\n    var nextResult;\n    try {\n      nextResult = fn.call(ctx, result);\n      return {returnVal: nextResult, error: false}\n    } catch (err) {\n      return {errorVal: err, error: true}\n    } finally {\n      // Wrap any resulting futures as continuations.\n      if (nextResult instanceof Promise) {\n        next.__asl_wrapper = function proxyWrapper() {\n          var aslWrapper = nextResult.__asl_wrapper || propagateAslWrapper;\n          return aslWrapper.apply(this, arguments);\n        }\n      } else {\n        ensureAslWrapper(next, true);\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  function wrapThen(original) {\n    return function wrappedThen() {\n      var promise = this;\n      var next = original.apply(promise, Array.prototype.map.call(arguments, bind));\n\n      next.__asl_wrapper = function proxyWrapper(ctx, fn, val, last) {\n        if (promise.__asl_wrapper) {\n          promise.__asl_wrapper(ctx, function () {}, null, next);\n          return next.__asl_wrapper(ctx, fn, val, last);\n        }\n        return propagateAslWrapper(ctx, fn, val, last);\n      }\n\n      return next;\n\n      // wrap callbacks (success, error) so that the callbacks will be called as a\n      // continuations of the resolve or reject call using the __asl_wrapper created above.\n      function bind(fn) {\n        if (typeof fn !== 'function') return fn;\n        return wrapCallback(function (val) {\n          var result = (promise.__asl_wrapper || propagateAslWrapper)(this, fn, val, next);\n          if (result.error) {\n            throw result.errorVal\n          } else {\n            return result.returnVal\n          }\n        });\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Shim activator for functions that have callback last\nfunction activator(fn) {\n  var fallback = function () {\n    var args;\n    var cbIdx = arguments.length - 1;\n    if (typeof arguments[cbIdx] === \"function\") {\n      args = Array(arguments.length)\n      for (var i = 0;
